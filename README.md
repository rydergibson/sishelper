# SISHelper
A little bit of code to aid teachers that use Aeries.


## Installation

1. Install the "Custom JavaScript for Websites 2" Chrome extension.
- Visit [this website](https://bit.ly/2V083H).
- Click on the blue "Add to Chrome" button to the right of the page.
- Click on "Add extension" when you see the prompt.
- Wait a few seconds and wham bam shamalam -- you've installed it!
2. Copy all of the code from [this website](http://bit.ly/sishelper) to your clipboard.
3. Visit [Aeries](https://aeries.lvusd.org).
4. Look in the top right hand corner of your Chrome window for text that reads "CJS" in all capitals. Click it.
5. Click on the text box that reads "// Here You can type your custom JavaScript...".
6. Paste the code that you copied previously into the text box.
7. Click the "Save" button in the top left hand corner of the window that was created when you clicked on the "CJS" letters. The page should reload. Make sure not to touch your keyboard or mouse until the window has completely loaded (You will know when it has fully loaded when the "logo" or "icon" for Aeries is visible in the left region of the Chrome tab).
8. Log in normally. I have not added any code to the Aeries sign-in page, so you won't be able to tell if it worked or not. Once you sign in, you should be met with a prompt greeting you and thanking you for installing SISHelper. Click "Okay" and go through the tutorial. The tutorial will show you how to use SISHelper to your advantage when doing things like putting in grades, making new assignments, taking attendance, and much, much more. The SISHelper tutorial can be viewed at any time by clicking on the blue "Show tutorial" button on the top right hand corner of the Aeries window.
19. Enjoy the full benefits of SISHelper.
